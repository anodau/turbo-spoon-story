Once there was a man named Joe who lived in New York City. Joe spent his 
days working at his family's pizza parlor. Even though the family business
is doing well, and he is excepted to take over the place, something deep down
in him tells him that this is not the right path for him. Deep down, he knew
that he wanted to be a writer.He decided to leave home and do what he really wants to do and having a more meaningful life.
Joe's parents did not approve, since the pizza parlor had been family-run for decades, but Joe was determined to follow his
dreams. Joe eventually lived on to be a world-renowed author, and his memoir about his family's pizza parlor ended up
being his defining piece. No matter where he went in life, pizza remained Joe's favorite food.
