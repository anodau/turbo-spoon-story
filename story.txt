Once there was a man named Joe who lived in New York City. Joe spent his 
days working at his family's pizza parlor. Even though the family business
is doing well, and he is excepted to take over the place, something deep down
in him tells him that this is not the right path for him. Deep down, he knew
that he wanted to be a writer.
